    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a *script*. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you've written in several programs without copying its definition into each program.\n",

    "-   The installation-dependent default.\n",
    "\n",
    "On file systems which support symlinks, the directory containing the input script is calculated after the symlink is followed. In other words the directory containing the symlink is **not** added to the module search path.\n",
    "\n",
    "After initialization, Python programs can modify sys.path. The directory containing the script being run is placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in that directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error unless the replacement is intended. See section [tut-standardmodules](tut-standardmodules.ipynb) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Compiled\" Python files\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the `__pycache__` directory under the name module.{version}.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the compiled file; it generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of spam.py would be cached as `__pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc`. This naming convention allows compiled modules from different releases and different versions of Python to coexist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python checks the modification date of the source against the compiled version to see if it's out of date and needs to be recompiled. This is a completely automatic process. Also, the compiled modules are platform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with different architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the result for the module that's loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if there is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must be in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tips for experts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can use the -O or -OO switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module. The `-O` switch removes assert statements, the `-OO` switch removes both assert statements and \\_\\_doc\\_\\_ strings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if you know what you're doing. \"Optimized\" modules have an `opt-` tag and are usually smaller. Future releases may change the effects of optimization.\n",
    "-   A program doesn't run any faster when it is read from a `.pyc` file than when it is read from a `.py` file; the only thing that's faster about `.pyc` files is the speed with which they are loaded.\n",
    "-   The module compileall can create .pyc files for all modules in a directory.\n",
    "-   There is more detail on this process, including a flow chart of the decisions, in 3147.\n",

    "## Standard Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library Reference (\"Library Reference\" hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access to operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for efficiency or to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls. The set of such modules is a configuration option which also depends on the underlying platform. For example, the winreg module is only provided on Windows systems. One particular module deserves some attention: sys, which is built into every Python interpreter. The variables `sys.ps1` and `sys.ps2` define the strings used as primary and secondary prompts:"

Just like the use of modules saves the authors of different modules from having to worry about each other's global variable names, the use of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having to worry about each other's module names.\n",

There are many different sound file formats (usually recognized by their extension, for example: .wav, .aiff, .au), so you may need to create and maintain a growing collection of modules for the conversion between the various file formats. There are also many different operations you might want to perform on sound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an equalizer function, creating an artificial stereo effect), so in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform these operations. Here's a possible structure for your package (expressed in terms of a hierarchical filesystem):"
