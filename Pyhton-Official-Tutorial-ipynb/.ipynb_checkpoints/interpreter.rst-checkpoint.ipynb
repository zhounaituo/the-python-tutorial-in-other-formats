    "Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn't work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: `quit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter's line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix [tut-interacting](tut-interacting.ipynb) for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if `^P` is echoed, command line editing isn't available; you'll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a *script* from that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way of starting the interpreter is `python -c command [arg] ...`, which executes the statement(s) in *command*, analogous to the shell's -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote *command* in its entirety with single quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using `python -m module [arg] ...`, which executes the source file for *module* as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.\n",

    "### Argument Passing\n",
    "\n",
    "When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the `argv` variable in the `sys` module. You can access this list by executing `import sys`. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, `sys.argv[0]` is an empty string. When the script name is given as `'-'` (meaning standard input), `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-'`. When -c *command* is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to `'-c'`. When -m *module* is used, `sys.argv[0]` is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c *command* or -m *module* are not consumed by the Python interpreter's option processing but left in `sys.argv` for the command or module to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactive Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in *interactive mode*. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the *primary prompt*, usually three greater-than signs (`>>>`); for continuation lines it prompts with the *secondary prompt*, by default three dots (`...`). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:"
